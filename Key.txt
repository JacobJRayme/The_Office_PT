ASA Configuration
{
Part 1:

Step 1: 
interface vlan 1
namif inside 
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
security-level 100

interface vlan 2 
nameif outside 
ip add 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.252
security-level 0

interface vlan 3
ip add 192.168.2.3 255.255.255.0
nameif dmz
security-level 70

Check connection to 192.168.1.1 from Michael Scott

Step 2 Getting connectivity:
a) Routing 
route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 1.1.1.2

b)PAT using Network Objects
object network inside-net 
subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 
nat (inside,outside) dynamic interface

Test the ping from Michael Scott to 1.1.1.2, why does it not work?

c) Create the class-map, policy-map, and service-policy. Add the inspection of ICMP traffic to the policy map list
class-map inspection_default
match default-inspection-traffic
exit
policy-map global_policy
class inspection_default
inspect icmp
exit
service-policy global_policy global
}

Step 3, configuring DHCP{

Give out the addresses starting from 192.168.1.4.
Make it so that it also hands out the dns ip of 192.168.2.1
Enable the DHCP daemon.

dhcpd address 192.168.1.4 - 192.168.1.35 inside 
dhcpd dns 192.168.2.1 interface inside 
dhcpd enable inside 
}

Step 4, Configure AAA to use local database for authentication{

So Michael needs to be authenticated, give him the username of 
prison_mike and the password dementors when he wants to ssh into network devices.

username prison_mike password dementors
aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL
}

Step 5, Configure Remote access to the ASA{
Only allow SSH connections from the inside network and set the timeout to 5 seconds

crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
no 
ssh 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0 inside
ssh timeout 5
}

Step 6, Configuring the DMZ{
int vlan 3 
ip add 192.168.2.3 255.255.255.0
no forward interface vlan 1
nameif dmz 
security-level 70
}

Step 7, Configure Static NAT to the DMZ server{
object network dmz-server
host 192.168.2.1
nat (dmz,outside) static 1.2.1.1
exit
}

Step 8, Configure an ACL to allow access to the DMZ server from the internet{
access-list OUTSIDE-DMZ permit icmp any host 192.168.2.1
access-list OUTSIDE-DMZ permit tcp any host 192.168.2.1 eq 80
access-group OUTSIDE-DMZ in interface outside 
}

Part 2:

;)
I *accidentally* typed the wrong password in R1. To show that you understand password recovery,
I made the password unencrypted so make the same password encrypted to get 22 points. 
answer: enable secret battlestar_galactica AND service password-encryption

Step 1: 
All the routers have been addressed but, for some reason Mr Stubblefield 
cannot communicate with the 1.0.0.0 /8 network. Why? Howcome he can communicate with the 3.0.0.0/8 and 2.0.0.0/8 Network?
Made OSPF preconfigured but R1 is missing a network
Made 2 default gateways on R0

Step 2 (didn't implement this):
Uh oh, Matthew Chan tries to ping 1.1.1.2 but it does not work. FIX IT
or you will be fired lol.

ip route 1.1.1.2 255.255.255.255 f1/0 on R2
ip route 1.1.1.2 255.255.255.255 f0/0 on R1

Step 3:
Make the default gateway for Vance refrigeration and Mr Stubblefield, Fault Tolerant. 
Make the virtual IP address the last IP of each subnet and make sure Mr Stubblefield 
can communicate with others after the configuration.

R1{
f0/0
standby 1 ip 1.1.2.254
standby 1 priority 50
standby 1 preempt
f1/0
standby 1 ip 1.1.3.254
standby 1 priority 75
standby 1 preempt
}

R2{
f0/0
standby 1 ip 1.1.3.254
standby 1 priority 50
standby 1 preempt
f1/0
standby 1 ip 1.1.2.254
standby 1 priority 75
standby 1 preempt
}

Step 4:
Configure AAA Server on R2 {
ip domain-name matthewchan.com
crypto key generate rsa
2048
aaa new-model
aaa authentication login default local enable
line vty 0 15
transport input ssh
login authentication default
}
